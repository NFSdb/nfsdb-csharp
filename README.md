NFSdb (www.nfsdb.org) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/NFSdb/nfsdb.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/NFSdb/nfsdb)
=====================

NFSdb is a low latency, high throughput embeded database. There are two binary compatible versions written entirely in Java and in C#. 
We use memory-mapped files to bring you fully persisted database with performance characteristics of in-memory cache.
The goal of this project is to make the fastest and most developer friendly database in the world.


### Getting started

### Performance

On test rig (Intel i7-920 @ 4Ghz) NFSdb shows average read latency of 20-30ns and write latency of 60ns per column of data. Read and write do not have any GC overhead.
